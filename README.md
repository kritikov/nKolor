nKolor is a color picker for Linux designed to make color selection simple and fast. The application has been tested on Linux Mint and is currently available as an AppImage, providing a straightforward installation and usage experience.

The application allows users to manage and select colors in several ways. Colors can be picked directly from the screen using a magnifier that provides pixel-accurate selection, or through the built-in HSV picker. It supports multiple color formats, including RGB, HSL, and HSV, with a live preview for every change. Users can also benefit from a color history, which stores recently used colors for quick reuse, and a similar color selection feature, which displays nearby tones to facilitate the creation of harmonious palettes.

System requirements include GTK 4 and basic Linux GUI libraries such as Cairo and GDK.
